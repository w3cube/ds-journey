### Learning Objectives

After this lesson, students will be able to:
- Explain how a decision tree is created.
- Build a decision tree model in scikit-learn.
- Tune a decision tree model and explain how tuning impacts the model.
- Interpret a tree diagram.
- Describe the key differences between regression and classification trees.
- Decide whether or not a decision tree is an appropriate model for a given problem.



## Student Requirements

Before this lesson, students should already be able to:
- Build and evaluate classification models in sklearn
- Explain how and when to apply different resampling methods
- Define the concepts of cross-validation and overfitting

## Additional Resources

*If you're interested in reading more about decision trees and random forests, check out these resources:*
- [Induction of Decision Trees](http://hunch.net/~coms-4771/quinlan.pdf)
- [Top 10 Algorithms in Data Mining](http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~icdm/algorithms/10Algorithms-08.pdf)

*If you're looking for additional references, we recommend the following books:*
- __CHAPTER 8__ - [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) - This book provides a fantastic introduction to machine learning models and the statistics behind them. The visuals and explanations are really easy to understand. PDF available to download on the website.
- __CHAPTER 9__ - [Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) - This book is by most of the same authors as the previous book, but goes into more detail. PDF available to download on the website.
- __CHAPTER 8__ - [Applied Predictive Modeling](https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Predictive-Modeling-Max-Kuhn/dp/1461468485) - While this book features R code, the discussion of different predictive models and sampling methodologies are hard to beat.
