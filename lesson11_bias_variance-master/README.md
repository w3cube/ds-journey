## Learning Objectives

After this lesson, students will be able to:
- **Describe** what error due to bias is and what error due to variance is
- **Identify** the bias-variance tradeoff
- **Describe** what overfitting and underfitting means in the context of model building
- **Explain** problems associated with over and underfitting
- **Grasp** why train, test split is necessary
- **Explore** kfolds, LOOCV, and three split methods

## Student Requirements

Before this lesson(s), students should already be able to:
- Read into data using the Pandas library
- Perform statistical exploration with Pandas
- Create simple data visualizations with matplotlib
- Define the basic parameters of sampling and experimental design
